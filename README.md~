# OSM_route_splitting_mesh
Create a DEM mesh of any size of a bounded region. 
==================================================

This repository contains a Python script, which could be used to generate mesh of any x and y size of a given bounded region. 
This is a supplementary script to OSM_route_length_calculation repository.


REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

1. You must have a full PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension installed for this to work.

2. Install psycopg2 and osgeo packages.


RUNNING SCRIPT
--------------------------------------------------

1. Open any tool where you can run Python codes. It could be linux-terminal, eclipse, pycharm etc.

2. Copy and Paste the content of the "script.py" file present in the current repository into your desired Python interpreter. 

3. Change the "connection" parameters (line 3) according to your system set-up. 

4. Enter the following values in decimal degrees (line 6-9): xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax.

5. Select your desired mesh size (line 10 and 11): xmesh and ymesh.

6. Hit the "Run" python button and wait for the completion message.

7. Check your database for a newly generated table named mesh_x_<xmesh>_y_<ymesh>.

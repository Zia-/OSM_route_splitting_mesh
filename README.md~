OSM_route_splitting_mesh


==================================================
Create a mesh table of any desired resolution, of a bounded region. 


This repository contains a Python script, which could be used to generate mesh table of any x and y resolution, of a given bounded region. 
This is a supplementary script to OSM_route_length_calculation repository (https://github.com/Zia-/OSM_route_length_calculation).


==================================================
Requirements

1- You must have a full PostgreSQL database, with PostGIS extension, installed for this to work.

2- Install psycopg2 and osgeo packages.


==================================================
Running Script

1- Open any tool where you can run Python codes. It could be linux-terminal, eclipse, pycharm etc. Eclipse Luna (4.4.1) IDE has been used in the following steps. 

2- Copy and Paste the content of "script.py" file of current repository into your desired Python interpreter. 

3- Change the "connection" parameters (line 3) according to your system set-up. Possible variables are 'database_name', 'postgres_user' and 'postgres_password', when the PostgreSQL databse is installed locally.

4- Enter the 'minimum_longitude_in_decimal_degrees', 'minimum_latitude_in_decimal_degrees', 'maximum_longitude_in_decimal_degrees' and 'maximum_latitude_in_decimal_degrees' values in decimal degrees (line 6-9). These are defining the extent of the area of study. Could be similar or larger than the extent defined in OSM_route_length_calculation repository (procedure 1).

5- Select your desired mesh size (line 10 and 11). Enter the variables 'x_size_of_desired_mesh_in_meters' and 'y_size_of_desired_mesh_in_meters' in meters.

6- Enter the EPSG code (line 12, variable 'EPSG_code_for_WGS84_UTM_zone') for your region's WGS84 UTM zone. One can find a detailed list at http://spatialreference.org/ref/ 

6- Hit the "Run" python button and wait for the completion message.

7- Check your database for a newly generated table, named as mesh_x_'x_size_of_desired_mesh_in_meters'_y_'y_size_of_desired_mesh_in_meters'.
